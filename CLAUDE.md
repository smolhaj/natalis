# natalis — Developer Context

## Vision

natalis is a life simulation game with a specific dual mandate: **fun and education in equal measure**. The goal is that a player who runs a character born in 1962 in Nigeria should come away understanding what that life was actually like — the regime, the economy, the religion, the technology available, the historical events that shaped the era — not just a generic set of stats.

Every system should ask: *does this reflect what it would actually have been like to be this person, in this place, at this time?* If it doesn't, it's not done yet.

The tone is literary, not gamey. Event text reads like short fiction — sparse, specific, emotionally honest. No exclamation points. No "You gain +5 Happiness!" framing. The prose is the experience.

---

## Tech Stack

React + Vite, Zustand for state. No backend. Everything is data-driven via plain JS object arrays. The build should always pass cleanly (`npm run build`).

---

## Architecture

### State (`src/store/gameStore.js`)

Key state fields:
- `stats`: `{ happiness, health, smarts, looks, charisma, wealth }` — all 0–100
- `money`: absolute dollar amount (separate from `wealth` stat)
- `karma`: 0–100
- `fame`: 0–100
- `flags`: string array — the game's memory. Everything conditional keys off flags.
- `age`, `currentYear`, `character` (birth data, frozen at game start)
- `currentCountry`: where the player *lives now* (can differ from `character.country` after emigration)
- `residencyStatus`: `'citizen' | 'permanent_resident' | 'work_visa' | 'undocumented' | 'refugee_status' | 'asylum_seeker' | 'tourist_overstay'`
- `inPrison`, `prisonSentence`, `criminalRecord`
- `pendingTrial`: `{ crimeName, crimeCategory, sentence, lawyerCosts: { none, mid, top } } | null` — blocks Age Up until resolved
- `career`, `education`, `partner`, `children`, `parents`, `siblings`, `friends`, `pets`
- `assets`: `{ properties: [], vehicles: [] }`
- `debt`, `creditScore`, `mortgage`
- `mentalHealth`: `{ condition, medicating, therapy }`
- `hobbies`, `fitness`, `gpa`, `socialMedia`, `martialArts`

### Life Phases (`src/engine/gameEngine.js: getPhase`)

```
early_childhood  ≤ 5
childhood        6–11
adolescence      12–17
young_adult      18–29
midlife          30–49
late_life        50+
```

**IMPORTANT**: Never use `phase: 'adult'` — it is not a valid phase and will silently prevent events from ever firing.

### Event System

Events live in:
- `src/data/events.js` — base events (1000+ inline) + imports all modules into `EVENTS` export
- `src/data/events_gender.js` — gender-specific events
- `src/data/events_religion.js` — religion-specific events
- `src/data/events_historical.js` — historical period events
- `src/data/events_culture.js` — regime/ethnicity/caste/LGBTQ/education events (68+ events)
- `src/data/events_technology.js` — technology timeline events (20 events, 1930s–2020s)
- `src/data/events_immigration.js` — emigration, residency, integration events
- `src/data/events_career_regime.js` — career × regime intersection events
- `src/data/events_conflict_childhood.js` — conflict zone childhood events
- `src/data/events_lgbtq.js` — LGBTQ identity and rights events
- `src/data/events_mental_health.js` — mental health arc events
- `src/data/events_grief.js` — grief and loss events
- `src/data/events_grief_mental.js` — grief-mental health intersection events
- `src/data/events_religion_arc.js` — faith arc events (crisis, conversion, return)
- `src/data/events_late_life.js` — 35 late-life events (retirement, partner decline, legacy, loneliness)
- `src/data/events_children_arc.js` — 28 events (child milestones, teen years, adult child relationships)
- `src/data/events_fame_karma.js` — 40 events (fame consequences, karma arcs, hobby payoffs, friendship depth)
- `src/data/events_texture.js` — 41 events (rural developing world, pre-1960 era, career peak/decline)
- `src/data/events_society.js` — 42 events (women's rights milestones by country/year, healthcare by archetype, language suppression/identity)

Event shape:
```js
{
  id: 'unique_id',
  phase: 'childhood',          // life phase this can fire in
  weight: 3,                   // relative probability
  when: (G) => boolean,        // guard condition
  text: 'prose...',
  choices: [                   // null for auto-resolve
    { text, tag, outcome, effect: (p) => { p.m += 5 } }
  ],
  effect: (p) => { ... },      // null if choices; only receives p — NOT G
}
```

**Critical**: `effect` functions receive only `p` (the proxy). `G` is only available in `when` guards. Never put G-dependent logic in effects.

The `G` object (built by `buildG()`) exposes everything event conditions need:
`G.character`, `G.stats`, `G.flags`, `G.mem`, `G.age`, `G.currentYear`, `G.career`, `G.partner`, `G.children`, `G.parents`, `G.money`, `G.karma`, `G.fame`, `G.regime`, `G.lgbtqCriminalized`, `G.casteSystem`, `G.childMarriageRisk`, `G.ruralUrban`, `G.ethnicity`, `G.religion`, `G.currentCountry`, `G.residencyStatus`, `G.inPrison`

Effect proxy shorthands (all are additive deltas):
- `p.m` → happiness, `p.h` → health, `p.e` → smarts, `p.s` → charisma, `p.w` → wealth stat, `p.lo` → looks
- `p.mo` → money (absolute dollars), `p.karma` → karma, `p.r` → regret
- `p.addFlag('flag_name')` — adds to flags array
- `p.setMem('key', value)` — stores value in `state.mem` (use for once-per-run guards)
- `p.killParent('father'|'mother')` — marks parent dead
- `p.killPartner()` — removes partner, sets widowed flag
- `p.setResidency('work_visa')` — sets residencyStatus
- `p.wipeMoney(fraction)` — deducts fraction of current money (e.g. `p.wipeMoney(0.3)` = lose 30%)
- `p.addFriend(name, quality)`, `p.updatePartnerRel(delta)`
- `p.updateChildRel(idx, delta)` — adjusts relationship quality for child at index idx
- `p.updateFriendRel(idx, delta)` — adjusts relationship quality for friend at index idx

### World Events (`src/data/worldEvents.js`)

93 world events. Fire based on year range + archetype/country match, independent of the normal event queue. Shape:
```js
{
  id, name, years: [start, end],
  archetypes: ['wealthy_west'] | 'all',
  countries: ['Germany'] | null,
  narrative: 'prose...',
  effect: (p) => { ... },
  addFlags: [],
  minAge: 0, maxAge: null,
  when: (G) => boolean,  // optional extra guard
}
```

Covers: WWII, Cold War (Berlin Wall, Cuban Missile Crisis, Prague Spring, Polish Solidarity, East Germany Stasi), famines (Holodomor, Great Leap Forward, Ethiopia), economic events (hyperinflation cycles, Japan bubble, Argentina 2001, Celtic Tiger, Korean miracle, Venezuela collapse, Gulf oil boom), national traumas (Troubles, Tiananmen, Apartheid, AIDS crisis), and more.

### Country Data (`src/data/countries.js`)

74 countries. Every country has:
```js
{
  name, archetype, gdp, yearRange,
  regime,           // starting political system
  regimeHistory: [{ year, to }],   // dated transitions
  religionWeights: { christian_catholic: 0.4, ... },
  ethnicGroups: [{ id, name, share, disadvantaged? }],
  casteSystem: bool,
  lgbtqCriminalized: bool,
  lgbtqLegalYear: number | null,
  childMarriageRisk: 0.0–0.5,
  urbanRate: 0.0–1.0,
  literacyMale: 0.0–1.0,
  literacyFemale: 0.0–1.0,
  context: 'lived-texture description...',
}
```

Country archetypes: `wealthy_west`, `wealthy_east`, `wealthy_gulf`, `post_soviet`, `developing_urban`, `developing_unstable`, `subsaharan`, `conflict_zone`

GDP tiers: `very_high`, `high`, `medium_high`, `medium`, `low_medium`, `low`, `very_low`

Regime types: `federal_republic`, `parliamentary_republic`, `constitutional_monarchy`, `absolute_monarchy`, `military_dictatorship`, `single_party_communist`, `single_party_authoritarian`, `theocracy`, `democracy`

The `getCountryRegime(country, year)` function in gameEngine applies `regimeHistory` transitions, so events can correctly gate on regime-at-the-time (e.g., Iran is `constitutional_monarchy` before 1979, `theocracy` after).

### Careers (`src/data/careers.js`)

Each career has: `id`, `title`, `field`, `levels[]`, `requirements`, `archetypeAvailable[]`, `gdpRequired`, `promotionChance`, `description`, and career-specific `events[]`. Modern careers have `minYear` (and optionally `maxYear`) to prevent anachronistic career choices. Current era-gated: `software_developer` (1985+), `data_scientist` (2010+), `content_creator` (2012+).

### Trial System (`src/store/gameStore.js: resolveTrial`)

When a crime attempt is caught (via `attemptCrime()`), instead of immediately going to prison, `pendingTrial` is set. This blocks Age Up. The player chooses a lawyer tier:
- **No lawyer / public defender**: low dismiss chance, high conviction
- **Mid-tier lawyer**: moderate chances
- **Top lawyer**: high dismiss chance (costs significant money)

Legal quality scales by regime: democracies have fair courts (1.0×), military dictatorships are stacked (0.35×). Lawyer fees scale by country GDP.

### Partner Lifecycle (`src/engine/gameEngine.js: tickPartner`)

Called each year via `advanceYear`. Partner ages +1/year. At age 75+ there's a death probability (increases with age). On death: partner removed, `widowed` or `lost_partner` flags set, death logged in lifeLog. Relationship quality drifts ±1 per year.

## The Immersion Principle

When adding anything — events, world events, career events, country data — ask:

1. **Time-accurate**: Would this exist in the year the player is experiencing it?
2. **Place-accurate**: Is this specific to this country/archetype, or is it generic?
3. **Perspective-accurate**: Is this told from the character's lived position (poor/rich, majority/minority, rural/urban, man/woman in that society)?
4. **Consequential**: Does it connect to real data fields (`lgbtqCriminalized`, `regime`, `literacyFemale`, `childMarriageRisk`, `casteSystem`, `ruralUrban`, `wealthTier`)?

Generic events are a last resort. Specific events — ones that could only fire for a Dalit woman in India in 1975, or a Chinese teenager during the Cultural Revolution, or a Nigerian kid skipping the landline era for mobile money — are the goal.

---

## Writing Style

- Second person, present tense: *"You arrive at the school and..."*
- Specific and concrete: name the object, the sound, the texture. Not "you feel sad" but "you do not get up for a day."
- No editorializing: don't tell the player what to feel. Show what happens.
- Short paragraphs. Never more than 4–5 sentences for an event body.
- Choices use plain declarative text, no ">" arrows or gamey framing.
- Outcome text is 1–2 sentences. The effect is felt, not narrated.

---

## Current State of the Codebase

### What exists and works

**Core systems:**
- 74 fully-populated countries with all demographic/political fields
- Career era-gating via `minYear`
- Country flag display + "Identity & World" stats card
- `currentCountry` + `residencyStatus` tracked separately from nationality
- Epitaph (DeathScreen) driven by accumulated flags — reads like an obituary
- Prison system with dedicated Prison Life tab, auto-navigation on incarceration
- Parent death wired to `ec_parent_loss` event; `tickPartner()` handles natural partner death at age 75+
- Trial system: `pendingTrial` state blocks Age Up; lawyer tier × legal quality × random = outcome
- Gender markers (♂/♀) next to all people in the Relationships UI
- `G.mem` key-value store for once-per-run event guards (use `p.setMem` / `G.mem?.key`)

**Event coverage (~800+ total events):**
- Base events covering all life phases with hundreds of inline events
- 68 culture events (regime, ethnicity, caste, LGBTQ, child marriage, rural, wealth)
- 20 technology timeline events (radio 1930s → COVID 2020s)
- 35 late-life events: retirement arc, partner decline/dementia/death arc, grandchildren, health decline, legacy reflection, loneliness
- 28 children arc events: school milestones, teen years, adult child relationships, child estrangement/reconciliation
- 40 fame/karma events: fame consequences at different tiers, karma payoffs, hobby payoffs (painting, music, writing, fitness, language, cooking), friendship depth arcs
- 41 texture events: rural developing world, pre-1960 era (rationing, radio, party phone lines), career peak/decline
- 42 society events: women's rights milestones by country/year (voting, credit, contraception, equal pay, divorce), healthcare system by archetype (NHS, US medical debt, Soviet polyclinic, developing world), language suppression and identity (Welsh Not, colonial education, code-switching, language grief)
- 93 world events: Cold War specifics, famines, economic cycles, national traumas

### What still needs work (priority order)

1. **Immigration activities** in ActivitiesPanel: "Apply for Permanent Residency" (after 5 years on work visa), "Apply for Citizenship" (after 10 years as permanent resident), "Seek Asylum"
2. **Residency consequences**: undocumented characters should face different event gates, health/wealth penalties, risk of deportation events
3. **More career-specific world event intersections**: a journalist in a military dictatorship faces different career events than one in a democracy
4. **Relationship depth**: friends/partner relationship events beyond the current basics
5. **Mobile money / fintech events**: characters in sub-Saharan Africa skipping the bank era for M-Pesa etc.
