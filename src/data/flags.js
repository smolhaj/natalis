/**
 * FLAG_REGISTRY — master design document for the natalis flag system.
 *
 * Every flag with weight 'major' or 'moderate' should appear here.
 * Pure texture flags (minor details with no narrative follow-through required)
 * can be omitted — the check-flags script will surface unregistered
 * high-frequency ones for review.
 *
 * Fields:
 *   weight      'major' | 'moderate' | 'minor'
 *               major   = life-defining; must surface in prose across decades
 *               moderate = significant; should surface at least once post-flag
 *               minor   = texture; no follow-through required
 *
 *   category    'trauma' | 'loss' | 'displacement' | 'identity' | 'achievement' |
 *               'relationship' | 'political' | 'world_event'
 *
 *   description What this flag represents in the character's lived experience.
 *
 *   intent      What follow-through should exist:
 *               'event'        = at least one dedicated follow-through event
 *               'year_texture' = should feed into buildYearTexture() prose
 *               'both'         = dedicated event AND year texture presence
 *               'none'         = texture label; no follow-through needed
 *
 *   timestamped true if flag is in TIMESTAMPED_FLAGS (auto-records year set in mem)
 *
 *   notes       Optional — current gaps, pending work, or caveats.
 *
 * Status ('covered' | 'partial' | 'orphaned') is NOT stored here.
 * Run `npm run check-flags` to derive it dynamically from source.
